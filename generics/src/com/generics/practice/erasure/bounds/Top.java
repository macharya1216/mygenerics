* Create an interface with two methods, and a class
* that implements that interface and adds another
* method. In another class, create a generic method
* with an argument type that is bounded by the
* interface, and show that the methods in the
* interface are callable inside this generic method.
* In main(), pass an instance of the implementing
* class to the generic method.
